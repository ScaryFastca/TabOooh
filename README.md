# TabOooh
A Simple tab cycling extension with a duration, number of tabs, and group only option.

Install the extension, pin to top of browser, and click the icon to open the UI.

Opening the UI will pause the tab cycling, but it doesn't currently unpause when closed. The pause button also doeesn't unpause, and I plan to fix both later.

The duration field has a minimum of 5 seconds but defaults to 15 seconds.

The number of tabs field defaults to all, and is overriden by the Group toggle.

When Group is toggled on it will only cycle between the tabs in the first tab group, and won't cycle at all if there is no group.

I did use ChatGPT to build the base for this, and it and Copilot to help me add changes that are beyond my limited ability.

It can be used in multiple browser windows independantly from each other, and will only cycle between tabs in its own window.
